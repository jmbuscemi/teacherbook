# Teacher Book
This app allows teachers to log into a simple system and create/update/delete parent e-mail addresses.

## Description
The database keeps track of the teacher's name, email address, and password; and keeps track of the parent's name, email address, and student's name.  
* Users who have not logged can only be able to see the login page.
* Teachers can:
  * Log in using their e-mail address and password.
  * See a message like "Hello, Mrs. Smith" at the top of every page.
  * Manage their list of parents (but not any other teachers' parents).
  * Change their own passwords.
  * Change their name without changing their password at the same time.
  * Log out.
* Teachers can not see other teachers' parents.
